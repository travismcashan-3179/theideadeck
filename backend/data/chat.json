For the second time in 2 years. After two techs and two \"diagnostic fees\" I was no closer to a working fridge. With a frustrated wife and 4 hungry kiddos, this needed to get fixed ASAP. I ran to the store and bought 6 bags of ice. Then got to work finding the right one to buy. We found one we liked and bought it at the factory outlet for $500 off of the already $1500 off it was listed at MSRP. I was able to purchase the 3-year extended warranty which I'd never do. I drove the two hours to San Antonio to pick it up. I took the opportunirty to finish an audio book I was reading called 10X is Easier than 2X and started a new one, Buy Back Your Time. While I was there I found a smaller fridge that would be great as a secondary for $300, I couldn't pass up the deal. When I went to put two fridges in my shortbed truck I couldn't close the tailgate. My tie down straps were too short. I had to run 4 blocks to Home Depot and buy new ones. It took me about an hour to make the run, buy the straps, run back, and strap down two refridgerators in the back of my truck with no tailgate up so they wouldn't fall out, in 105 Texas sun beating down. While in San Antonio I thought to call my bestie and grab a quick dinner. I was able to see his apartment and new puppy for the first time, it was amazing. We had a great dinner. On my way home, I called my bestie back and we talked for almost an hour, catching up on all things business and business strategy. I got home around 11:30pm and my wife helped me unload the smaller of the two fridges. We had time to watch a show together and went to sleep.\n\nThere's two ways to look at this story, the gap and the gain. \n\nThe gap is...\n\n- My fridge died and was JUST outside warranty\n- The manufacturer couldn't find anyone in our area to help us\n- All our food spoiled\n- I spent $250 and two hours on two technicians that couldn't help \n- We had to spend $2K on a new fridge unexpectedly\n- The only option was wait 2 weeks or pick drive 5 hours round trip to pick one up\n- I had to buy new tie-down strips\n- I spent a lot of time in the car and traffic\n\nThe gain is...\n\n- My wife and I had been in a quibble and this snapped us out of it, got us talking, and over it\n- We found a new fridge we liked and we had the savings to pay for it\n- We saved thousands and got the extended warranty\n- I found an amazing deal on a second fridge that I couldn't pass up\n- I was able to finish one audiobook and start a new one\n- I was able to visit my best friend and see his new place and puppy\n- I also followed that up with a great phone call in the car\n- I bought some nice new tie down straps\n- I jogged for the first time in 4 weeks since a hamgstring injury to the nearest HomeDepot and felt great\n- I had a lot of quality me time\n- I looked like a hero to my wife and kiddos for \"saving the day\" and bringing home a new fridge\n- I learned my truck can hold two large fridges \n\nWhich do you think helps you achieve and level up and get the most out of life? Living in the gap or living in the gain?!\n\n—————\n\nWED, AUG 28\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__7nOJ3MGpY&t=126s\nBest lesson my father taught me was...\n\nMON, AUG 26,\n\nBirds, feeders and birdfood\nUX and learning\n\nTUES, AUG 27,\n\nVideo riding OneWheel\nNosty award and a \"thank you\" speech\n\nWED, AUG 28\n\nSales call lowball budget\nBut org is doing 40% on ~$30M in revenue\nAND they are wanting to exit\nTake the call and voila they are a definite ICP and ideal client match\n\nWED, AUG 28\n\nFirst successful L10 by operations team\nIt's been 5 years and the CEO/VP weren't on the call\nIt's finally happening...\n\nTHU, AUG 29\n\nWhat is the best newsletter for business leaders, marketing agencies, and creative professionals?\n\nWED, JAN 8\n\nWriting letter to prospective job seeker\n\nTHURS, JAN 9\n\nWhat got you to here won’t get you to there\n\nHow am I being complicit in creating the situations I say I don't want?\n\n2/13/25\n\nTHe power of YET!  3/14/25\n\nEnterprise has structure but less agility\nSMB have agility but less structure\nMidmarket have some structure and some agility\n\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ted-lasso-renewed-season-4-apple-tv-1236163347/\n\nABC of culture\n\n—————\n\nPSA to marketing leaders\n\n—————\n\nLooking at 1000 agencies\n\n—————\n\nMarketing should be boring.\n\nHear me out. Many years ago, I was young and zealous and hustling to grow the company. Realizing I knew nothing about sales I came across a fellow who had a massive impact on my early years in sales, Wes Schafer, wes you're a legend, THANK YOU!\n\nOne of the first things he told me was that sales should be boring. I was surprised and he had my attention. The gist was that your sales and marketing was so dialed, so well-tuned that it was automatic, uneventful and consistent. In word, BORING.\n\n\nSo, I leaned into this obsession. I even built a simple, one-page interactive app (Google Spreadsheet + ChatGPT) to help recommend books when people ask.\nBecause every time someone says, “What should I read?”, my ADD brain immediately goes: “Ooooh, how much time do you have?” 😂\nEventually, I want to add notes on the breakthroughs each book gave me.\n(Link in the comments)\n\n—————\n\njenny plan account management\n\n—————\n\nYour success or failure as an agency in one graphic.\n\nI’m convinced 2025 is the line in the sand for many marketing agencies.\n\nThe knowledge economy is dead.

Order-takers. Fighting for relevance. ✅ Level 3 & 4 agencies → Partners. Trusted advisors. Driving outcomes. \nAs a marketing leader, you already know the difference. One type of agency makes your job harder. The other makes your job easier.\n\nWinning agencies aren’t just checking boxes. They’re: ✅ Challenging thinking, not just executing tasks. ✅ Focused on business outcomes, not just marketing metrics. \nIf your agency still operates like an order taker instead of a challenger, or a servicer instead of a trusted leader, they’re on borrowed time. \nWhich type of agency are you working with?\n\n—————\n\nThe best marketing doesn’t even need words\nEagles\n\n\n—————\nAre you leaving money on the table?\n—————\nDesigned IA is a lot like designing a children’s school\n—————\n# AI job writing post (job seeker)\n—————\n# Everything started as shit before it wasn’t\n—————\n# Emperors new groove old is new ————— # I officially boycott type DECK to get XYZ.

    "text": "My fridge died. For the second time in 2 years. After two techs and two \"diagnostic fees\" I was no closer to a working fridge. With a frustrated wife and 4 hungry kiddos, this needed to get fixed ASAP. I ran to the store and bought 6 bags of ice. Then got to work finding the right one to buy. We found one we liked and bought it at the factory outlet for $500 off of the already $1500 off it was listed at MSRP. I was able to purchase the 3-year extended warranty which I'd never do. I drove the two hours to San Antonio to pick it up. I took the opportunirty to finish an audio book I was reading called 10X is Easier than 2X and started a new one, Buy Back Your Time. While I was there I found a smaller fridge that would be great as a secondary for $300, I couldn't pass up the deal. When I went to put two fridges in my shortbed truck I couldn't close the tailgate. My tie down straps were too short. I had to run 4 blocks to Home Depot and buy new ones. It took me about an hour to make the run, buy the straps, run back, and strap down two refridgerators in the back of my truck with no tailgate up so they wouldn't fall out, in 105 Texas sun beating down. While in San Antonio I thought to call my bestie and grab a quick dinner. I was able to see his apartment and new puppy for the first time, it was amazing. We had a great dinner. On my way home, I called my bestie back and we talked for almost an hour, catching up on all things business and business strategy. I got home around 11:30pm and my wife helped me unload the smaller of the two fridges. We had time to watch a show together and went to sleep.\n",
